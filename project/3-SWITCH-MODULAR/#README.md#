## Description
This program uses interrupts to detect when a switch is pressed or
released.

Both LEDS, Press S1, and the green LED remains illuminated while the red LED will turn off.

This implementation separates different domains of control to different files:

* led.c controls the leds based on state vars
* switches.c responds to the switch and sets the values of state vars
